# GIFt-ed

As an iOS developer one of the tasks that I have to do is attaching meaning full GIFs to Pull Requets descriptions, (or send them over to someone over Slack). 
This is cumbersome task for me. I have to context switch in my mind and lose focus on what I was working on. Steps involve QuickTime, some local scripts, etc and then sometimes realizing that I have to do it all over again because I missed an important detail or the GIF is not of good quality or the file size is too large. 

To alleviate this problem I have created a macOS taskbar tool to create GIFs and manage simulators.

## Installation

Download and build the project using the Install_GIFted_In_Applications scheme.

## Usage

The app will appear in your taskbar after you launch it from Applications.
